## 1. Document Processing Pipeline

### Text Splitting

**Why**: Large documents can't be processed efficiently as a whole due to context window limitations and embedding quality issues. Breaking documents into smaller chunks improves retrieval precision and allows the system to focus on relevant sections.

**How it works**: 
```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` works by:
1. Attempting to split text at natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences)
2. If chunks are still too large, moving to smaller delimiters recursively
3. Maintaining overlap between chunks to preserve context across boundaries

**Where in the code**: This happens in both `rag.py` and `confluence_rag.py` during the initial document ingestion and when updating the knowledge base.

**What more you can do**:
- **Customize splitting logic**: Create custom splitters for different document types
  ```python
  code_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
      chunk_size=1500,
      chunk_overlap=200,
      separators=["\nclass ", "\ndef ", "\n\n", "\n", " "]
  )
  ```
- **Semantic chunking**: Split based on meaning rather than character count
  ```python
  from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker
  semantic_splitter = SemanticChunker(embeddings)
  ```
- **Metadata-aware splitting**: Preserve document structure in metadata
  ```python
  # Add section headers as metadata
  for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
      chunk.metadata["section"] = section_headers[i]
  ```

### Embedding Generation

**Why**: Text must be converted to numerical vectors to enable semantic search. These embeddings capture the meaning of text in a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are close together.

**How it works**:
```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Later used to create vector embeddings of each chunk
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embeddings)
```

The embedding process:
1. Each text chunk is sent to OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
2. The model returns a vector (typically 1536 dimensions for OpenAI's embeddings)
3. These vectors are stored in the vector database with references to the original text

**Where in the code**: The embedding model is initialized at the start of both RAG implementations and used whenever documents are added to the vector store.

**What more you can do**:
- **Use different embedding models**: Swap in other embedding providers
  ```python
  from langchain_cohere import CohereEmbeddings
  embeddings = CohereEmbeddings(model="embed-english-v3.0")
  ```
- **Custom embedding pipelines**: Pre-process text before embedding
  ```python
  def clean_text_for_embedding(text):
      # Remove special characters, normalize whitespace, etc.
      return cleaned_text
      
  # Apply to chunks before embedding
  cleaned_chunks = [clean_text_for_embedding(chunk.page_content) for chunk in chunks]
  ```
- **Hybrid embeddings**: Combine different embedding models
  ```python
  # Example concept (would require custom implementation)
  combined_embeddings = [OpenAIEmbeddings(), CohereEmbeddings()]
  ```

### Vector Storage

**Why**: Vector databases efficiently store and index embeddings for similarity search. They use specialized algorithms to quickly find the most similar vectors to a query.

**How it works**:
```python
# ChromaDB implementation
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=splits,
    embedding=embeddings,
    collection_name=collection_name,
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"
)

# FAISS implementation
vectordb = FAISS.from_documents(
    documents=splits,
    embedding=embeddings,
)
vectordb.save_local("./faiss_index")
```

The vector storage process:
1. Each document chunk and its embedding are stored together
2. An index is built for efficient similarity search
3. The database is persisted to disk for later retrieval

**Where in the code**: Vector databases are created during initial document processing and loaded/updated during query operations.

**What more you can do**:
- **Filtering**: Add metadata filtering capabilities
  ```python
  # Add metadata during ingestion
  for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
      doc.metadata["category"] = categories[i]
      
  # Filter during retrieval
  retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(
      search_kwargs={"filter": {"category": "technical"}}
  )
  ```
- **Hybrid search**: Combine vector and keyword search
  ```python
  # This would require a custom retriever implementation
  results = vectordb.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(query, k=10)
  keyword_results = keyword_search(query, documents)
  combined_results = combine_results(results, keyword_results)
  ```
- **Quantization**: Compress vectors for better performance
  ```python
  # With FAISS
  import faiss
  dimension = 1536  # Embedding dimension
  index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension), dimension, 100)
  # Train and add vectors to the index
  ```
- **Clustering**: Group similar documents for improved organization
  ```python
  # Example concept
  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  # Extract all vectors
  vectors = [vectordb.get_embedding(doc_id) for doc_id in vectordb.get_all_ids()]
  kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10).fit(vectors)
  # Assign cluster IDs to documents
  ```

## 2. Retrieval System

**Why**: When a user asks a question, the system needs to find the most relevant information from the knowledge base. The retriever is responsible for this search.

**How it works**:
```python
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 3}
)
```

The retrieval process:
1. The user query is converted to an embedding using the same model
2. The vector database searches for the most similar document chunks
3. The top k (3 in this case) most similar chunks are returned

**Where in the code**: The retriever is created within the `query_rag` function in both implementations.

**What more you can do**:
- **Maximum marginal relevance (MMR)**: Balance relevance with diversity
  ```python
  retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(
      search_type="mmr",
      search_kwargs={"k": 5, "fetch_k": 20}
  )
  ```
- **Re-ranking**: Apply a secondary ranking to initial results
  ```python
  from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
  from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor
  
  compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
  compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
      base_retriever=retriever,
      doc_compressor=compressor
  )
  ```
- **Query transformation**: Expand or refine the original query
  ```python
  from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
  from langchain.chains import LLMChain
  
  query_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
      "Generate three different versions of this query to improve search results: {query}"
  )
  query_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=query_prompt)
  expanded_queries = query_chain.run(query)
  
  # Run multiple searches and combine results
  ```
- **Multi-step retrieval**: Break complex queries into sub-queries
  ```python
  # Example concept for multi-hop retrieval
  def multi_hop_retrieval(query, retriever, hops=2):
      context = ""
      for i in range(hops):
          docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
          context += "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
          query = f"Based on this context: {context}\n{query}"
      return context
  ```

## 3. LLM Integration

**Why**: The LLM generates human-like responses based on the retrieved information and the user's query. It interprets the context and formulates a coherent answer.

**How it works**:
```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
```

The LLM process:
1. The model receives the prompt with context and query
2. It processes the information and generates a relevant response
3. The response is returned to the user

**Where in the code**: The LLM is initialized early in the pipeline and used in the `query_rag` function.

**What more you can do**:
- **Model selection based on complexity**: Use different models for different needs
  ```python
  def select_model(query_complexity):
      if query_complexity == "high":
          return ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
      else:
          return ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
  ```
- **Streaming responses**: Show responses as they're generated
  ```python
  llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", streaming=True)
  
  # With callback handler
  from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
  llm = ChatOpenAI(
      model="gpt-4o",
      streaming=True,
      callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]
  )
  ```
- **Structured output**: Get responses in specific formats
  ```python
  from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
  
  class Answer(BaseModel):
      answer: str = Field(description="The answer to the question")
      sources: list[str] = Field(description="Sources used to answer the question")
      confidence: float = Field(description="Confidence score between 0 and 1")
  
  # Then use with structured output parser
  ```
- **Self-critique and refinement**: Let the model refine its own answers
  ```python
  def generate_refined_answer(query, context):
      initial_answer = llm(f"Question: {query}\nContext: {context}")
      critique = llm(f"Please critique this answer: {initial_answer}")
      final_answer = llm(f"Question: {query}\nContext: {context}\nCritique: {critique}\nImproved answer:")
      return final_answer
  ```

## 4. Prompting Strategy

**Why**: The prompt design is crucial for effective RAG. It instructs the model on how to use the retrieved information and shapes the response quality.

**How it works**:
```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
Answer the following question based only on the provided context:

<context>
{context}
</context>

Question: {input}
""")
```

The prompting process:
1. The template defines how context and query are presented to the LLM
2. It includes instructions on how to use the context
3. The populated template is sent to the LLM for processing

**Where in the code**: The prompt template is defined in the `query_rag` function.

**What more you can do**:
- **Role-based prompting**: Assign a specific role to the LLM
  ```python
  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
  You are a knowledgeable technical expert who excels at explaining complex concepts clearly.
  
  Answer the following question based only on the provided context:
  
  <context>
  {context}
  </context>
  
  Question: {input}
  
  If the context doesn't contain relevant information, say "I don't have enough information to answer this question."
  """)
  ```
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Guide the model through a reasoning process
  ```python
  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
  Answer the following question based only on the provided context:
  
  <context>
  {context}
  </context>
  
  Question: {input}
  
  Please follow these steps:
  1. Identify the key pieces of information in the context relevant to the question
  2. Consider what the question is asking for specifically
  3. Formulate your answer using only the identified information
  4. Cite the specific parts of the context your answer is based on
  """)
  ```
- **Few-shot examples**: Include examples of ideal answers
  ```python
  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
  Answer the following question based only on the provided context:
  
  <context>
  {context}
  </context>
  
  Question: {input}
  
  Here are examples of good answers:
  
  Example 1:
  Question: What is RAG?
  Context: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It combines retrieval systems with generative models.
  Answer: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines retrieval systems with generative models.
  
  Now provide your answer in a similar format:
  """)
  ```
- **Answer formatting instructions**: Control response structure
  ```python
  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
  Answer the following question based only on the provided context:
  
  <context>
  {context}
  </context>
  
  Question: {input}
  
  Format your answer as follows:
  Answer: [Your concise answer]
  Explanation: [Detailed explanation]
  Sources: [References to specific parts of the context]
  Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on how well the context supports your answer]
  """)
  ```

## 5. Retrieval-Augmented Chain

**Why**: The chain connects all components into a seamless pipeline, coordinating the flow from query to retrieval to generation.

**How it works**:
```python
document_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)

# Usage
response = retrieval_chain.invoke({"input": query})
```

The chain process:
1. The query is passed to the chain
2. The retriever fetches relevant documents
3. Documents are "stuffed" into the prompt template
4. The populated prompt is sent to the LLM
5. The LLM's response is returned

**Where in the code**: The chain is created and invoked in the `query_rag` function.

**What more you can do**:
- **Custom chains**: Create specialized chains for different document types
  ```python
  technical_retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(
      search_kwargs={"filter": {"doctype": "technical"}}
  )
  policy_retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(
      search_kwargs={"filter": {"doctype": "policy"}}
  )
  
  # Create specialized chains for each type
  technical_chain = create_retrieval_chain(technical_retriever, document_chain)
  policy_chain = create_retrieval_chain(policy_retriever, document_chain)
  
  # Route queries to appropriate chain based on classification
  ```
- **Map-reduce chains**: Process documents individually then combine results
  ```python
  from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_map_reduce_documents_chain
  
  map_reduce_chain = create_map_reduce_documents_chain(
      llm,
      question_prompt,  # Prompt for processing each document
      combine_prompt    # Prompt for combining results
  )
  ```
- **Refine chains**: Iteratively improve answers with additional context
  ```python
  from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_refine_documents_chain
  
  refine_chain = create_refine_documents_chain(
      llm,
      question_prompt,  # Initial prompt
      refine_prompt     # Prompt for refinement with additional context
  )
  ```
- **Conversational memory**: Maintain context across multiple queries
  ```python
  from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
  
  memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
  
  # Modify prompt to include conversation history
  conversational_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
  Previous conversation:
  {chat_history}
  
  Context:
  {context}
  
  Question: {input}
  """)
  
  # Update chain creation to include memory
  ```

These enhancements to the core components can significantly improve the performance, accuracy, and capabilities of your RAG system. By understanding the "why, where, and how" of each component, you can make targeted improvements that address specific needs in your implementation.
